Step 1: Extract Relevant Information from SAS Script

# Read in the SAS script as a PySpark DataFrame
sas_script_df = spark.read.text("path/to/sas_script.sas")

# Define a list of SAS commands to search for
sas_commands = ["PROC SQL", "DATA", "RUN", "QUIT"]

# Filter the SAS script to only include relevant lines
relevant_lines_df = sas_script_df.filter(
    lambda row: any(command in row.value for command in sas_commands)
)

# Show the resulting lines for debugging purposes
relevant_lines_df.show()
